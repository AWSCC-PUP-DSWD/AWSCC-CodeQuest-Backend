For your final project, you are tasked to create a Password Manager Website.

**Requirements**:

- Users should be able to generate new passwords by specifying the associated website and email.
- Users can modify existing entries by updating the website, email, or password information.
- Users have the option to delete stored passwords.
- Users can access and view all the data they have entered.

This is the **FINAL PROJECT** for the CodeQuest in Backend, which will be the Day 28-30. Use everything that you have learned in the whole month of coding to accomplish this task. You are not required to design the front-end, but you can of course design the website however you like. **Good luck and have fun coding!**
